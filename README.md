## Nextauth example
Nextjs application with external authorization based on Nextauth library. My main idea is to give an example of the way it could be done with a couple of providers.
If you want to correct, suggest, or help my work you can create a pull request from your own fork repository.
You can check the result of the project on https://nextjs-nextauth-example.vercel.app/ 
Hope you like my project and it be useful for you. 

For running locally, you have run the next commands on the root project:

    $ npm install
    $ npm run dev
